# Integer Overflow - Example
A while ago I was playing the <a href="https://www.hackingesports.com.br/">UHC</a> qualifier and in one of the challenges there was this one, that to get the flag, you had to explore an integer overflow and make you have enough money to buy the flag and thus win the CTF.

I found it quite interesting and as it had been my first contact with this vulnerability, I decided to explore it a little deeper. As I didn't get the code of the original application, I created this similar one and thus be able to better study this vulnerability.

This is an Integer Overflow challenge, as stated above. If you are studying this vulnerability, try this challenge and get the flag! (without looking at the code, lol).
